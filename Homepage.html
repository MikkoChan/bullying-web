                <h2>Legal Framework Against Bullying</h2>
                <p>Under DepEd Order No. 55 s. 2013 or the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act (RA) No. 10627 or the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013, bullying refers to "any severe, or repeated use by one or more students of a written, verbal or electronic expression, or a physical act or gesture, or any combination thereof, directed at another student that has the effect of actually causing or placing the latter in reasonable fear of physical or emotional harm or damage to his property, creating a hostile environment at school for the other student; infringing on the rights of another student at school, or materially and substantially disrupting the education process or the orderly operation of a school."</p>
                <p>Experts said students who experience bullying are seen to be at increased risk for depression, anxiety, sleep difficulties, and lower academic achievement.</p>
                <p>Under RA 10627, any school employee who commits bullying shall be punished by a fine of not less than PHP50,000 but not more than PHP100,000, at least six months but not more than one year of imprisonment, or both fine and imprisonment. (PNA)</p>
